## Visual Vault

# Description of the Project

The challenge of this project was to work collaboratively as a team to create our very first full stack application. Our application is called 'Visual Vault'. It is a website that serves as a platform for developers to show off their project repositories. It also allows users to actively engage with other developers by giving reactions using emojis. This creates a fun environment for developers to interact with each other. Furthermore, we hope that the website can become a platform for employers to view projects of potential candidates. Registered users will be able to add their social profiles including; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. This will allow for further interaction between employers and developers beyond Visual Vault.
