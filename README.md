## Visual Vault

# Description of the Project

The challenge of this project was to work collaboratively as a team to create our very first full stack application. Our application is called 'Visual Vault'. It is a website that serves as a platform for developers to show off their project repositories. It also allows users to actively engage with other developers by giving reactions using emojis. This creates a fun environment for developers to interact with each other. Also, the platform will be used by employers, to be able to view potential candidates for employment.
